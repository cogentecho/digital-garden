**Source: [Forget Network Layers—Cortical Columns Think Like Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2I59RkTX9s)**

## **Part 1: Executive Summary & Final Score**

### **Overall Conclusion**

This report presents a rigorous meta-analysis of a composite analytical toolkit comprising eight distinct frameworks for decision-making and problem-solving. The analysis reveals that this toolkit, while containing individually powerful models, is an internally inconsistent collection drawn from disparate epistemological traditions, including statistical empiricism, business heuristics, and postmodern philosophy. Frameworks such as the Predictive Validity Test and Signal vs. Noise Separation are rooted in quantifiable, objective measurement, offering rigorous methods for assessing data quality and forecasting accuracy. In contrast, models like First Principles Thinking are ideologically biased toward market disruption, while the "Physics of Progress" functions more as a psychological tool for anxiety reduction than a scientifically valid process. The most significant internal contradiction arises between the disruptive impetus of First Principles and the profound risk aversion encouraged by N-Order Consequence Mapping. Furthermore, the toolkit's philosophical components, particularly the Frame of Reference Deconstruction, use the language of scientific objectivity as a rhetorical vehicle to advance a post-structuralist critique of truth itself. The effective application of this toolkit, therefore, does not lie in its wholesale deployment but in a sophisticated, context-aware selection of the appropriate tool. Its use requires a high degree of critical self-awareness from the analyst to manage its inherent tensions and ideological biases, distinguishing between models that seek objective truth and those designed to deconstruct it.

## **Part 2: Detailed Analytical Breakdown**

### **2.1. Predictive Validity Test**

#### **Analysis**

The concept of predictive validity is a cornerstone of psychometrics and is frequently invoked in fields requiring the forecasting of human behavior, such as education, psychology, and human resources.1 It is formally defined as the extent to which a measure or test accurately predicts a future outcome or behavior.1 As a subtype of criterion validity, it is distinguished from concurrent validity, where the test and criterion are measured simultaneously, and from construct validity, which assesses whether a test measures the concept it purports to measure.2 The assessment of predictive validity is quantitative, typically involving the calculation of a correlation coefficient, such as Pearson's

r, between the test scores (the predictor) and the future criterion measure.3 A strong positive correlation is interpreted as evidence of high predictive validity.1

The core testable prediction embedded within the literature is that a high correlation coefficient signifies a test's utility for high-stakes decision-making. Examples abound: standardized test scores like the SAT are used to predict a student's first-year college GPA; pre-hire assessments are used to predict future job performance; and personality inventories are used to predict behavioral tendencies.5 The implicit model is that a statistically significant correlation provides a reliable basis for selecting candidates or making interventions. A study might find, for example, that a survey for new employees has high predictive validity if its scores strongly correlate with employee retention rates one year later.4

However, a critical triangulation of the claims against the data provided within the same source materials reveals a significant tension. While the qualitative descriptions often refer to tests as "strong predictors," the quantitative reality is more modest.1 In social sciences, the magnitude of correlations from predictive validity studies is acknowledged to be "usually not high".7 A typical predictive validity for an employment test might yield a correlation in the neighborhood of

r=.35.7 Many psychological assessments produce correlations of less than

r\<0.5.5

This discrepancy exposes a critical distinction between statistical significance and practical predictive power. A correlation coefficient of r=.35 is statistically meaningful, but its coefficient of determination (r2) is approximately 0.12. This means the test score explains only about 12% of the variance in the future outcome (e.g., job performance). The remaining 88% of the variance is attributable to other factors not captured by the test. While a 12% explanatory power can provide a non-trivial utility in large-scale selection processes, describing it as a "strong predictor" is a rhetorical inflation of its actual forecasting capability. The case of SAT scores predicting freshman GPA is illustrative; while there is a positive correlation, it is far from perfect, and many other variables influence academic success.5

The genuine value of the predictive validity framework is therefore not in its ability to offer deterministic forecasts of individual futures, but in its capacity to precisely quantify the strength—and, more importantly, the weakness—of a predictive relationship. The "signal" provided by this framework is the rigorous, statistical measure of a model's limited predictive power and the vast uncertainty that remains. The "noise" is the oversimplified narrative that these tests are powerful forecasting tools. The framework's greatest utility lies in managing expectations and forcing decision-makers to confront the probabilistic and highly uncertain nature of predicting human behavior, rather than providing them with a crystal ball.

### **2.2. "Physics of Progress" Audit**

#### **Analysis**

The "Physics of Progress" is a six-phase framework articulated by entrepreneur Tom Bilyeu, designed to transform business problems into "solvable equations" by applying a methodology purported to mirror the universal laws of physics.9 The framework is presented as the system used to build Quest Nutrition into a billion-dollar company.9 Before analysis, it is necessary to separate the relevant source material describing this business heuristic 9 from unrelated documents concerning the "theory of everything" in theoretical physics.10 This initial step clarifies that Bilyeu's use of "physics" is metaphorical, not literal, framing the system as one of rigor and universal applicability. Applying the framework's own structure to itself provides a robust test of its internal consistency and intellectual honesty.

1. **Goal:** The declared goal of the "Physics of Progress" is to provide a universally applicable framework that makes every business problem solvable through a simple, repeatable six-phase process.9  
2. **Hypothesis:** The framework's core, testable hypothesis is: "The most effective way to solve business problems is to apply this specific six-phase framework".9  
3. **Test/Evidence:** The primary evidence presented to support this hypothesis is anecdotal and singular: the success of Quest Nutrition.9 The sources repeatedly link the framework to the company's billion-dollar valuation.12 However, the materials fail to provide any specific, data-driven case study demonstrating how each phase of the framework was systematically applied to a particular problem at Quest Nutrition, what the documented outcomes were, and how confounding variables were controlled for.9 The evidence is a post-hoc narrative of success, not a controlled experiment.  
4. **Data Interpretation:** The interpretation of the Quest Nutrition success story is entirely subjective. It suffers from severe survivorship bias, ignoring the countless failed companies that may have used similar methodical approaches. The framework's own mandate to "test one variable at a time" is fundamentally violated in its own proof.9 The success of Quest Nutrition was the result of innumerable variables—market timing, product-market fit, team dynamics, branding, and luck, among others—making it impossible to isolate the framework as the causal variable.  
5. **Intellectual Honesty:** The framework is presented with a high degree of dogma, using absolutist language such as "exact systems," "universal laws," and "solvable equation".9 It does not acknowledge the anecdotal nature of its evidence, the complexity of causal attribution in business success, or the existence of alternative problem-solving methodologies. It fails to demonstrate a willingness to be wrong, a key component of the scientific mindset it claims to emulate.

The recursive application of the "Physics of Progress" to itself reveals that it fails to meet its own standards of scientific rigor. Its central claim to be like "physics" is an unsubstantiated metaphor. This leads to a deeper question about its actual function. Entrepreneurship is an endeavor characterized by profound uncertainty, ambiguity, and psychological stress. The framework's language—"physics," "science," "equation"—imposes a narrative of order, predictability, and control onto this inherently chaotic reality. Therefore, the framework's primary utility is not empirical but psychological. It serves as a powerful rhetorical device to reduce the anxiety of the founder or leader by providing a structured mental scaffold for approaching unstructured problems. Its value lies in promoting a methodical mindset of goal-setting, hypothesizing, and testing, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, it is not a scientifically validated "law" of business, but rather a cognitive tool for managing complexity and the emotional burden of decision-making under uncertainty.

#### **Score: Physics of Progress Score**

4/10

### **2.3. First Principles Analysis**

#### **Analysis**

First Principles Thinking is a problem-solving methodology that involves deconstructing complex issues into their most fundamental, irreducible truths and reasoning upward from that foundation.14 This approach stands in contrast to reasoning by analogy, which involves making incremental improvements on existing solutions and conventions.16 The principal techniques for uncovering these foundational truths are Socratic questioning and the "Five Whys" method, which repeatedly asks "Why?" to peel back layers of assumptions.14 To assess the integrity of this framework, one can apply the "Five Whys" technique to the advocacy for First Principles Thinking itself.

1. **Why should one use First Principles Thinking?** To break down complicated problems and build novel, innovative solutions from scratch, thereby moving beyond the limitations of incremental improvement.14  
2. **Why is building novel solutions from scratch considered superior to incremental improvement?** Because reasoning by analogy—the alternative—only produces variations of what already exists. This method traps the thinker within the confines of convention, past assumptions, and the solutions of others, limiting the potential for true innovation.14  
3. **Why is it so critical to escape the confines of convention?** Because existing conventions and systems often obscure fundamental truths and prevent the kind of revolutionary breakthroughs that confer the greatest competitive advantage. The canonical example is Elon Musk's approach to SpaceX. He rejected the conventional high price of rockets and instead broke the problem down to the commodity cost of the raw materials, revealing that the convention was inefficient, not fundamental.14  
4. **Why is revolutionary breakthrough the most desired outcome?** Because existing systems are assumed to be suboptimal and inefficient. The high cost of rockets was not a fundamental law of physics but a contingent outcome of a flawed, conventional manufacturing process that could be radically improved.14 The goal is not to build a slightly better version of the existing system, but to create a new, vastly superior one.  
5. **Why is it assumed that existing systems are inherently suboptimal and that disruptive change is the highest form of progress?** This final question cannot be answered by appealing to a more fundamental truth within the framework. It is the framework's foundational, axiomatic belief.

This deconstruction reveals two unstated core axioms upon which the entire argument for First Principles Thinking rests:

* **Axiom 1: The Axiom of Suboptimality:** This axiom holds that existing systems, conventions, and analogies are, by default, presumed to be fundamentally flawed, inefficient, and ripe for replacement.  
* **Axiom 2: The Axiom of Disruptive Supremacy:** This axiom posits that progress is defined not by gradual, incremental improvement (kaizen) but by disruptive, revolutionary change. The highest value is placed on creating something fundamentally new, not on refining or stewarding what already exists.

The identification of these axioms demonstrates that First Principles Thinking is not a neutral, universally applicable problem-solving technique. It carries a powerful ideological bias. This bias is heavily aligned with a particular brand of Silicon Valley techno-optimism, which lionizes the disruptor and the innovator. The framework is exquisitely optimized for domains like engineering, software development, and new market creation, where the goal is to build a novel product or upend an incumbent industry. However, its inherent bias makes it a poor tool for domains where tradition, stewardship, incrementalism, and maintenance are paramount. Fields such as diplomacy, ecological conservation, cultural preservation, or caregiving rely on values that are often de-emphasized or implicitly devalued by a framework that presumes existing structures are suboptimal and must be deconstructed. Therefore, the effective application of First Principles Thinking requires a conscious understanding of its inherent orientation toward radical change; it is a tool for building the new, but it is ill-suited for preserving the valuable old.

### **2.4. Incentive Analysis**

#### **Analysis**

The principle of "following the incentives" posits that understanding the motivations—financial, reputational, ideological, and psychological—of the actors involved can reveal the underlying forces that shape a message, its framing, and the selection of information. An incentive analysis of the provided materials on incentive systems themselves reveals a complex ecosystem of actors whose motivations significantly influence the discourse. The authors within the source material can be broadly categorized into two groups, each with a distinct set of incentives.

**Group A: Business Consultants and Software Vendors.** This group, represented by sources focused on corporate incentive compensation, has clear and direct incentives.18 Their primary motivation is

**financial**: to sell consulting services and sophisticated software platforms designed to manage and analyze incentive programs. A secondary incentive is **reputational**: to establish themselves as thought leaders and indispensable experts in the field of performance management. These incentives shape their message in a predictable way. They frame incentive compensation as a highly complex, data-intensive challenge that requires specialized tools like predictive modeling, "what-if" scenarios, and integrated dashboards pulling data from numerous corporate systems (CRM, HRIS, payroll).19 This framing serves to create demand for their products by portraying the problem as too difficult for a company to solve without their expert assistance.

**Group B: Healthcare and Public Policy Researchers.** This group is motivated by a different set of incentives.21 Their primary incentives are

**reputational**—achieving publication in respected academic journals—and **financial**, in the form of securing grants to fund further research. There may also be an **ideological** incentive to promote evidence-based policymaking. Their framing of the issue is one of scientific inquiry, testing the efficacy of incentives as a policy lever. However, their findings are notably contradictory. One large-scale case study from British Columbia concludes that incentive payments to primary care physicians reduced net healthcare costs and hospital utilization for several chronic conditions.23 Conversely, a broad review article from

*Annual Reviews* concludes that financial incentives in healthcare have generally had "limited impact," have not led to better patient outcomes, and are ineffectively designed.24

The interplay between these two groups creates a self-perpetuating system. The complexity and data-centric narrative promoted by the business consultants and vendors reinforces the idea that incentive systems are a rich and important area for academic study. The often ambiguous or conflicting results produced by the academic researchers—where incentives sometimes work and sometimes do not—in turn reinforce the business narrative that navigating this complexity requires expert guidance and sophisticated software tools. The academic finding that many incentive programs are "ineffectively designed" serves as a perfect marketing pitch for consultants who claim to offer effective design.

The underlying worldview being sold by both groups, irrespective of their specific findings, is a form of managerialism: the belief that human motivation is a technical problem that can be systematically engineered, measured, and optimized. The discourse is not a neutral exploration of the nature of incentives. It is a marketplace where a specific, quantifiable, and technocratic view of human behavior is the true product. The incentives of both consultants and researchers are aligned not necessarily to solve the problem of motivation definitively, but to sustain the conversation about it, as the conversation itself generates revenue and reputation.

### **2.5. N-Order Consequence Mapping**

#### **Analysis**

N-order consequence mapping, also known as second-order thinking, is a mental model for decision-making that urges the practitioner to look beyond the immediate, intended results of an action and consider the subsequent, downstream effects.25 By repeatedly asking the question, "And then what?", the thinker maps out the potential ripple effects of a decision over time, often categorizing them into first-order (immediate), second-order (indirect), and third-order (long-term, systemic) consequences.27 The goal is to avoid short-term gains that lead to long-term pain and to make more strategic, resilient choices.26 A critical analysis, however, involves applying this very framework to the widespread adoption of second-order thinking itself as a primary mode of decision-making.

* **First-Order Consequence (Intended):** The immediate and intended result of adopting second-order thinking is that individuals and organizations make more thoughtful, strategic, and robust decisions. By considering the long-term, they avoid pitfalls like the "chocolate bar dilemma"—satisfying an immediate craving at the expense of future health.26 In business strategy, this is exemplified by Jeff Bezos's investment in Amazon's infrastructure, which sacrificed short-term profits for long-term market dominance.31 In geopolitics, it would prevent actions like arming a group of "moderate rebels" who later become a long-term adversary.26 This leads to improved risk management and a greater likelihood of achieving sustainable success.27  
* **Second-Order Consequence (Unintended):** The widespread adoption of this framework would lead to a significant increase in cognitive load and a marked decrease in the speed of decision-making. The process of mapping complex, branching, and highly uncertain futures for every significant decision is immensely time-consuming and mentally taxing. This creates a strong bias towards inaction, a state often described as "paralysis of analysis".33 The potential negative second- and third-order consequences of any bold action can almost always be imagined to outweigh the clear and certain first-order benefits. The framework is therefore poorly suited for environments that demand rapid, intuitive, or emergent decision-making, such as emergencies or fast-moving competitive markets.31  
* **Third-Order Consequence (Systemic):** If second-order thinking were to become the dominant decision-making paradigm at an industry-wide or societal level, it could lead to systemic risk aversion and a profound stagnation of innovation. The very process of trial-and-error that drives progress would be stifled by the preemptive analysis of all possible negative downstream effects. A society fully optimized for second-order thinking would likely not have funded Columbus's voyage, started SpaceX, or pursued countless other high-risk, high-reward ventures whose negative second- and third-order consequences were unknowable but potentially catastrophic. It prioritizes the avoidance of failure over the pursuit of breakthrough success.

This consequence mapping reveals a fundamental contradiction within the analytical toolkit presented. The toolkit contains both First Principles Thinking, which is ideologically biased toward radical disruption and innovation, and N-Order Consequence Mapping, which is structurally biased toward caution, stability, and risk mitigation. These two frameworks are in direct philosophical opposition. One encourages tearing down existing structures based on axiomatic truths, while the other advises extreme caution due to the unpredictable and potentially harmful downstream effects of any major change. An analyst attempting to apply the entire toolkit wholesale to a single problem would face a paralyzing paradox. This demonstrates that the toolkit is not a coherent, unified system of thought. Rather, it is a collection of disparate, context-dependent mental models. Its utility lies not in its comprehensive application, but in the user's wisdom to diagnose a specific situation and select the single, appropriate tool—using First Principles for an innovation problem, and N-Order Mapping for a safety or regulatory problem.

### **2.6. Frame of Reference Deconstruction**

#### **Analysis**

The user's prompt specifies an analytical tool named "Frame of Reference Deconstruction" and implicitly constructs it by merging two profoundly different concepts found in the source material: the "frame of reference" from physics and "deconstruction" from postmodern philosophy. A deconstruction of this hybrid tool itself is necessary to understand its function, its internal contradictions, and the way it predetermines analytical outcomes.

The first constituent concept, the **Frame of Reference**, originates in physics and astronomy. It is defined as an abstract coordinate system with a specified origin, orientation, and scale, used to make consistent and objective measurements of physical phenomena.34 An inertial frame of reference, for example, is one in which the laws of physics take on their simplest form. The entire purpose of this concept is to establish a stable, agreed-upon ground for empirical observation and the construction of objective knowledge. It is a foundational tool of positivism and the scientific method.

The second constituent concept, **Deconstruction**, is a philosophical method pioneered by Jacques Derrida. To deconstruct a text is to take it apart along its structural "fault lines" to reveal its internal contradictions, its reliance on "violent hierarchies" (such as speech over writing, or presence over absence), and the ultimate instability and deferral of meaning.35 Deconstruction challenges the very possibility of a single, stable, objective meaning, arguing that any text contains multiple, irreconcilable interpretations.36 It is a primary tool of post-structuralism, an epistemological tradition that is fundamentally critical of positivism's claims to objective truth.

These two frames are epistemologically incompatible. The physics frame is a tool for building objective knowledge upon a stable foundation. The deconstruction frame is a tool for demonstrating why such a foundation is an illusion and why objective knowledge is impossible. The prompt's synthesis of these two into a single analytical framework is a powerful rhetorical act that must be analyzed.

By packaging these opposing concepts together, the creator of the toolkit performs a subtle but significant maneuver. The scientific, objective, and authoritative connotations of the "physics" frame are borrowed to lend legitimacy and apparent rigor to the philosophical "deconstruction" frame. This hybrid tool effectively instructs the analyst to perform a two-step process that is designed to arrive at a pre-ordained conclusion. First, the analyst is to identify the "frame of reference" of an argument—its structure, its coordinate system, its foundational points. Second, the analyst is to "deconstruct" this very frame, revealing how its seemingly objective structure is, in fact, arbitrary, unstable, and an instrument of a "violent hierarchy" that represses alternative meanings.35

The tool is therefore not a neutral lens for analysis; it is an engine for generating a specific type of critical theory. It uses the authority of science as a "Trojan horse" to deliver a post-structuralist critique. The analyst who uses this tool is not on a "truth hunt" to discover an objective reality. Instead, they are being guided through a process designed to demonstrate that objective reality is a construct of the very frame used to observe it. The conclusion is predetermined by the structure of the tool itself.

### **2.7. Logical Fallacy & Rhetoric Audit**

#### **Analysis**

A systematic audit of logical fallacies and rhetorical strategies is a critical tool for ensuring the integrity of an argument. This framework involves identifying formal and informal fallacies—errors in reasoning that invalidate an argument—and the persuasive techniques used to influence an audience. The provided source materials offer extensive lists of such fallacies, ranging from standard academic classifications to more stylized and polemical catalogs.33 A meta-analytical application of this audit to the materials describing the fallacies themselves reveals that the presentation of these concepts is not always logically or rhetorically neutral.

A detailed examination, particularly of the extensive list provided by the University of Texas at El Paso, reveals the use of rhetorical strategies within the very definitions of the fallacies.33

* **Poisoning the Well / Ad Hominem:** This source frequently employs pejorative and loaded language in the names and descriptions of the fallacies. Terms like "Shearing the Sheeple" (for Ableism), "The Simpleton's Fallacy," or the "Drama Queen / Drama King Fallacy" (for Playing on Emotion) do more than define a logical error; they attack the character and intelligence of anyone who might employ such an argument.33 This rhetorically frames the arguments as inherently malicious or foolish, pre-emptively discrediting a potential arguer rather than focusing purely on the logical structure of their claim.  
* **Appeal to Emotion:** The same source uses emotionally charged language to persuade the reader of a fallacy's severity. Describing the "Appeal to Heaven" as an "extremely dangerous fallacy" that has "caused endless bloodshed" is an appeal to fear and outrage, a form of pathos intended to underscore the concept's importance.33  
* **Hasty Generalization:** Multiple sources make broad claims about the frequency of certain fallacies, stating they are "extremely common" or "commonly used" without providing empirical data, such as content analyses of political speeches or media, to substantiate these generalizations.33  
* **False Dilemma in Political Analysis:** The analyses of the 2024 political debates, while identifying clear instances of fallacious reasoning, can also fall prey to oversimplification.40 Complex political statements, which may involve nuanced rhetorical positioning, are sometimes forced into a binary classification of either "fallacious" or "not fallacious," potentially ignoring hybrid strategies that do not fit neatly into a textbook definition.

This audit of the source material leads to a crucial realization about the application of the framework itself. The act of labeling an opponent's argument as a "fallacy"—for example, by publicly declaring "That's a Straw Man\!" or "You're engaging in an Ad Hominem attack\!"—can be a powerful rhetorical tactic in its own right. It can be used to dismiss an entire line of reasoning wholesale, without engaging with its substance. This tactic shifts the focus of the debate from the issue at hand to a meta-discussion about the rules of argumentation, a maneuver that can effectively shut down productive dialogue.

This creates a paradox: a tool designed to promote and defend logical rigor can be weaponized to avoid it. The fallacy audit framework is most valuable when used as a tool for self-critique and for the careful, nuanced analysis of an argument's structure. However, it can be misused as a rhetorical bludgeon to "win" a debate by disqualifying an opponent's argument on procedural grounds rather than engaging with its content. A truly rigorous application of this framework therefore requires a high degree of intellectual honesty, where the analyst distinguishes carefully between identifying a genuine flaw in reasoning and simply using a fallacy label as a tool of dismissal.

### **2.8. Signal vs. Noise Separation**

#### **Analysis**

The Signal vs. Noise framework is a mental model for separating meaningful information from irrelevant distractions.43 To properly evaluate this framework, it is essential to apply its own principles to the body of literature that describes it. This involves separating the core, verifiable concept—the "signal"—from its metaphorical, subjective, and often misleading applications—the "noise."

The core **signal** of this framework is its origin in information theory, statistics, and engineering. In these fields, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a precise, quantifiable, and verifiable measure of the quality of data.45 It is the ratio of the power of a meaningful signal to the power of background noise. This concept has robust and valuable applications in fields that rely on data integrity, such as machine learning, where filtering noise is crucial for model accuracy, and quantitative finance, where identifying true market signals amidst random price fluctuations is paramount.45 This statistical foundation is the framework's verifiable and intellectually sound core.

The **noise**, in this context, is the framework's metaphorical extension into the realms of general productivity, leadership advice, and qualitative business strategy.44 In these domains, the terms "signal" and "noise" lose their quantitative precision and become subjective synonyms for "what I deem important" and "what I choose to ignore," respectively. For instance, one source presents a case study where Netflix's successful pivot to streaming is retrospectively labeled as "acting on signals," while Blockbuster's failure is framed as "ignoring them".48 This is not an analysis; it is a post-hoc narrative construction. A good business decision is relabeled as "seeing the signal," and a bad one is relabeled as "getting lost in the noise." This application offers no predictive or analytical power; it merely provides a new vocabulary for telling old stories. The framework becomes a tool for creating an illusion of analytical depth while simply stating that successful people made good choices and unsuccessful people made bad ones.

An analysis of the provided materials shows that the metaphorical "noise" application is discussed far more frequently and prominently than the statistical "signal" concept. The scientific authority and precision of the term "Signal-to-Noise Ratio" are borrowed to lend an aura of gravitas and objectivity to what is often subjective business advice.

This reveals the primary function of the Signal vs. Noise framework in its popular business context. It is not an analytical tool but a **narrative** one. It provides a powerful and compelling vocabulary for constructing stories about success and failure. In these narratives, successful leaders are portrayed as possessing a unique ability to "see the signal through the noise," while failed leaders are depicted as being overwhelmed by distractions. This narrative transforms complex historical events with multiple, interacting causal factors (market conditions, technological shifts, organizational culture, luck) into a simple, heroic story about the perceptual genius and focus of a single individual. The framework's main function, therefore, is to create easily digestible myths that reinforce a "Great Man" theory of leadership and business success. It is less a tool for rigorous, forward-looking analysis and more a tool for retrospective storytelling and myth-making.
