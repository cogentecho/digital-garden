All right, let's jump right in. Today, we're looking at the Magnificent 7, but not as just seven different stocks. No, for those of you actually building in AI, it's way more powerful to see them as a single interconnected system. It's like one giant machine that's setting the rules and the reality of your day-to-day work. Okay, this quote right here, this is the core idea. This is the mental model we're going to build today. So, for a minute, just forget the stock tickers. I want you to picture this as a complex engine. If you understand how The gears turn and connect. You can decode the headlines and really see the deep forces shaping the entire AI landscape. So where do we start? We start at the heart of the machine, the constant highstakes battle for raw compute power. I mean this is where it all begins. And here's where we see this the central tension in AI right now. The big hyperscalers, you know, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, they're playing a really fascinating double game. On one hand, they are Nvidia's biggest customers buying every single Blackwell G PU they can get their hands on, but at the exact same time, they're all building their own custom chips to try and control their own destiny to escape that total dependency. It's this wild dynamic of buying and building all at once. You know, when compute is this scarce, old rivalries start to get well, blurry. Even fierce competitors have to work together. I mean, just look at Meta, an ads rival to Google, right? They just signed a massive $10 billion deal to use Google's cloud and TPUs. Or how about OpenAI, Microsoft's golden child? also tapping Google for TPUs. It's a super clear signal that getting your hands on compute power trumps absolutely everything else. So, how do these giants signal their plans and honestly their fears to each other and to the market? Well, they speak a very specific language, the language of capital expenditure or capex. These aren't just boring budget numbers. They are strategic moves on a global chessboard. First, just take a second and absorb this number. $30 billion. That's what Microsoft is planning to spend in a single quarter and almost all of it is going to AI infrastructure. That is a record- setting number that just screams they are going allin trying to build an unreachable moat of compute power. And of course, not to be outdone, you've got Alphabet raising its guidance for next year to a staggering $85 billion. This isn't just a small tweak. It's a huge signal that they plan to use their own infrastructure, especially their custom TPUs, as a major weapon in this AI arms race. And Meta is right there with them, right? They're focusing almost all of their $70 billion capex squarely on AI. When you see all three of these giants spending on this kind of astronomical scale, you know they're all reacting to the exact same thing, a massive systemwide bottleneck in AI ready infrastructure. Their spending is just a direct reflection of that scarcity. Of course, this whole engine isn't operating in some perfect vacuum. Nope. It's constantly being squeezed and shaped by these powerful outside forces that can literally change the rules of the game overnight. And that brings us to these four big constraints, the physical and political ones. I mean, think about it. It doesn't matter how amazing your new AI model is if you can't get the advanced cows packaging for your chips or if you can't secure enough megawatts from the power grid or if some new export rule suddenly cuts off a key market. These are the hard physical realities that can gate progress. And here is A perfect example of one of these feedback loops in action. A single policy decision gets made in Washington to tighten export controls that directly forces a chip redesign in Santa Clara with Nvidia creating these specific less powerful GPUs just for the Chinese market. And in turn, the hyperscalers have to completely rethink their global data center strategy, shifting compute clusters away from certain regions. See, one political move creates ripples across the entire tech stack. Okay, so as an engineer or a strategist working in this world, how can you actually use this systems framework. How do you make it a practical tool for seeing what's coming around the corner? You can think of this table as your own personal cheat sheet. It gives you a set of if then rules to translate a headline into its most likely second order effect. So, for example, if you read an article that HBM, the high bandwidth memory that's crucial for GPUs, is in short supply, you can pretty confidently predict what's going to happen next. The hyperscalers will probably raise their capex to lock down what they can, and they'll pour even more money into their custom chip programs as a hedge. And this brings us to a really key insight. Some events are predictable leading indicators for others. The system has a rhythm. So news about the supply of key components like HBM or advanced packaging. It doesn't just happen in isolation. It reliably predicts what the hyperscalers are going to announce in their quarterly earnings calls about 4 to 8 weeks later. If you watch the right signal today, you're basically seeing the future. So We'll end with this question for you to think about. We've talked about compute, capex, all these external pressures. Now, using this framework, where do you think the next fragile link in the chain is? Is it going to be a geopolitical flare up, a sudden energy crisis in a key data center region, or maybe a new unexpected bottleneck in the semiconductor supply chain? Because the next big shock to this whole system, it's probably going to come from one of those single points of failure.
